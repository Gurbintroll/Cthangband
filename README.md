# Cthangband
This is the Cthangband roguelike game. It's a 'classic' roguelike in that it uses ASCII characters rather than graphics.

It works on any computer running Windows 7, 8, or 10 (although if you are running on Windows 7 or 8 you may need to download the .NET Framework 4.5.2 first).

Cthangband started off as a variant of the Angband game, although since it is over two decades since they forked (the first Cthangband release was in 1998) the two have drifed apart over the years. While they still have a lot in common in broad gameplay concepts, much of the detail is different between the two (and, in fact, the two are no longer even written in the same programming language).
