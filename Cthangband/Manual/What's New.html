        <li>Fixed occasional crash where the game would try to delete a non-existent monster.</li>
        <li>Recovery rate is now properly shown as a multiplier on the character sheet, rather than a misleading "Regen" bonus, since it does not actually affect health regeneration; only poison/stun/bleeding recovery rate.</li>
        <li>When choosing to re-use a character, the character gains a generation after their name (which is displayed on the high score table, save game preview, and gravestone). For example, "Bob", "Bob II", "Bob III", "Bob IV"...</li>
        <li>High Score Table is now versioned, so you're only comparing scores with characters who have had the same game experience as you.</li>
        <li>New in-game "Cthangpedia" documentation added.</li>
        <li>"Organic" cavern levels added (using the same Perlin Noise algorithm as the new terrain).</li>
        <li>Lighting and line-of-sight is now visible on more than just basic walls and floors.</li>

    <h2>Cthangband 6.1</h2>

        <li>Fixed bug in character viewer where "Shots per Round" and "Blows per Round" were showing incorrect values.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where unidentified ammunition wasn't re-stacking when being picked up again after having been fired.</li>
        <li>Fixed obscure bug where a particular combination of recalling and taking the stairs in different dungeons could result in a town temporarily containing the wrong shops.</li>
        <li>Pets will now *actually* follow you from level to level. Usually.</li>
        <li>New journal page added, listing current pets.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where selling a pile of items would tell you it was giving you the money for all of them but would actually only give you the money for one of them.</li>
