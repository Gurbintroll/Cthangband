    <h1>Favour</h1>
    <p>
        There are five <a href="Great Ones.html">Great Ones</a> that take an interest in adventurers, and each one will have an opinion on
        your character. By default, they will all be indifferent to you, but it is possible to change that opinion by accruing a score known
        as Favour.
    </p>
    <p>
        You gain favour with a particular Great One by sacrificing items to them at a temple. The type of item sacrificed does not matter, only
        the value of the item. The more valuable the item, the more favour you will gain with the Great One to whom you sacrificed it.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, favour is a zero-sum game. Sacrificing to one Great One may please it, but it will also upset the others. This means that
        your total combined favour with all the Great Ones is always zero - the only way to get one of the Great Ones to love you is to accept
        that the other Great Ones will resent you, and getting positive favour with more than one Great One at the same time will require
        repeated sacrifices.
    </p>
    <p>
        The good news is that while Great Ones with whom you have positive favour will help you, those with whom you have negative favour will
        not hinder you. Instead they will simply ignore you. On the one hand this means that you can happily ignore the Great Ones altogether and
        if you never sacrifice to them they leave you alone. On the other hand, it means that there is nothing to lose by sacrificing to any of
        the Great Ones (other than losing the items you have sacrificed, of course) as sacrifices will gain you benefits from the Great One who
        now favours you but not give you any penalties from the others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, the Great Ones cease caring about sacrifices you have previously made; and your favour scores (both positive and negative)
        decay back to zero. No matter how large a sacrifice you make, after a few weeks of game time the Great Ones will be indifferent towards
        you once more. The exception to this is if you are a <a href="Priest.html">priest</a>. Each priest has a specific Great One as a patron,
        and their 'resting state' is to have a positive favour score with that patron and a negative favour score with each of the other Great Ones.
        If you are a priest, your favour scores will decay back to those values rather than decaying back to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can view your standing with the various Great Ones at any time by checking your journal, but this does not show your exact favour
        score with each one, only how much they like you.
    </p>
    <h2>Favour Calculations</h2>
    <p>
        By default, you have a favour score of 0 with each of the five Great Ones, unless you are a priest - in which case you have a favour
        score of 120 with your patron and a favour score of -30 with each of the other four Great Ones (so you still have a total favour of
        zero). This is your 'resting favour' and it is the set of values that your favour score will slowly revert back to.
    </p>
    <p>
        You gain additional favour by sacrificing items. Assuming you sacrifice an item of value, you will gain 4 favour with the Great One to
        whom you sacrificed it per 10 gold that the item is worth, and you will lose 1 favour with each of the other four Great Ones per 10 gold that
        the item is worth. If you accidentally (or deliberately) sacrifice a worthless item to a Great One, you will lose 40 favour with them
        and gain 10 favour with each of the other four.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each day, at midnight, the game checks each of the Great Ones to see which of them you have the most favour with compared to your
        resting favour with that Great One. Assuming you are not at your resting favour with all the Great Ones, it then calculates 10%
        (rounded down, but with a minimum of 1) of that increased favour as a 'decay' value. Your favour with that Great One is then
        reduced by four times the decay value, while your favour with each of the other four is increased by the decay value.
    </p>
    <h2>Favour Benefits</h2>
    <p>
        Your favour with each Great One is converted into a bonus using the following conversion:

        The percentage bonuses in the table above are applied in situations based on each individual patron:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hagarg Ryonis: The bonus is the chance to ignore poison or life drain.</li>
        <li>Lobon: The bonus is the chance to ignore effects that drain your ability scores.</li>
        <li>Nath-Horthath: The bonus is applied directly to your maximum health.</li>
        <li>Tamash: The bonus is applied directly to your maximum vril.</li>
        <li>Zo-Kalar: The bonus halved is the chance to negate an effect that would otherwise kill you.</li>
    </ul>
