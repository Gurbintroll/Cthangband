        Warriors are better at fighting than any other class in the game. They are also the only class that does not use magic of one
        form or another. This makes warriors the easiest class for new players to get started with, since in the early game they are simple
        to play and their combat skills help them survive. They also need less experience to increase in level than any other class.

        In the later game they need to use magic items to do things that other classes can do with spells, so they become
        somewhat trickier to play, although they remain a viable choice (and new players are extremely unlikely to have their character survive to the point
        where this becomes an issue, so it shouldn't put you off choosing this class).
