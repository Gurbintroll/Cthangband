    <h1>Great Ones</h1>
    <p>
        The Great Ones are the lesser gods of the dreamlands. Although powerful, they are far below the great old ones is scale and they
        are subservient to the whims of Nyarlathotep. The Great Ones formerly lived in the city of Kadath, although they have recently
        left the city for reasons unknown and it lies empty and in ruins.
    </p>

        The Great Ones are willing to help adventurers who gain their <a href="Favour.html">favour</a>, and this favour can be gained either
        by being a priest of one of the Great Ones or by sacrificing items to them at a temple - although the latter is soon forgotten by these
        fickle entities.
