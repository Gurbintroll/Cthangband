    <h1>Patrons</h1>
    <p>
        All Cultists and Fanatics are devoted to a particular patron (determined randomly at character generation), and each time a character belonging
        to one of those classes increases in level their patron will either reward or punish them. This is not based on any specific actions that you may
        have performed, but is at the capricious whim of the patron (i.e. in game terms it's random).
    </p>
    <p>
        Because each patron is different, the chances of any particular category of reward or punishment vary from patron to patron.
        The table below shows the chance for each patron to give you a reward or punishment from each category when you increase in level.
        The rewards and/or punishments are independent of each other, so getting a reward repeatedly will not make you 'due' a punishment
        or vice versa. However, the chance of getting a punishment instead of a reward does vary from level to level, although even when
        they are at their greatest a reward is still far more likely.

        Descriptions of the individual rewards and punishment options within each category are given below. Just because a patron chooses to
        give a reward or punishment from a particular category doesn't mean that there is an equal chance of them giving each of the individual rewards or punishments
        from within that category. Patrons will usually favour different individual rewards or punishments and often there will be individual rewards
        or punishments that a patron will never give no matter how many times they choose that category.
