    <h1>Mutations</h1>
    <p>
        Mutations are caused by the inability of mortal bodies to handle the eldritch energies of raw chaos without warping and changing.
        Mutations can be gained from a number of sources, ranging from the misuse of chaos magic to the whim of patron gods. Additionally, miri nigri gain mutations whenever they increase in level.
        There are three basic types of mutation, those that are always active, those that activate randomly, and those that the possessor can voluntarily activate.
    <p>Mutations are not named, so the descriptions here are based on the descriptions that you see when you use the journal.</p>
    <h2>Persistent Mutations</h2>
    <p>
        Persistent mutations are always active once you have acquired them. They have a passive effect that doesn't need to be
        (and in fact can't be) switched on and off.
