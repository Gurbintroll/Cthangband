    <h1>Martial Arts</h1>
    <p>
        When attacking without a weapon, a <a href="Monk.html">monk</a> or <a href="Mystic.html">mystic</a>character gets special martial arts
        attacks. These start with just a single punch at level 1 and culminating in a Crushing Blow at level 48.

    <p>
        Each time you make a martial arts attack, the game chooses an attack at random from those of your level or below (with equal
        chance of each), and then rolls a die with the same number of sides as your level. If this die is <em>less than</em> the
        difficulty of the attack then the attack is re-selected. This may result in the same attack being selected and rolled for
        again.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, let's say that a 23rd level character is making a martial arts attack, and the game randomly selects the 'Double
        Kick' attack from the list of attacks of 23rd level and lower ('Punch' to 'Cat's Claw'). This has a difficulty of 15, so the game
        rolls a 23-sided die and if it gets a 14 or lower (i.e. less than the difficulty) on the roll then it re-selects the attack; otherwise it proceeds with the double
        kick.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game makes this selection once per seven levels your character has, taking the best of the chosen attacks as the one you will use.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if you are stunned or confused you can only do basic 'Punch' attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the 'Ankle Kick' attack may only slow opponents that have legs. Against opponents that do not have legs, this attack
        will be simply described as a 'kick' and will not do its slowing. However, the attack will still do the full 3d4 damage rather
        than the 1d6 damage done by a normal kick.
