    <h1>Death Spells</h1>
    <p>
        Spells are presented here ordered by book.
        This does not necessarily reflect how difficult each spell is to cast.
        Although within the first two books (Black Prayers and Black Mass) the spells are ordered in increasing difficulty,
        each of the two rare books that can only be found in the dungeons (Cultes Des Goules and The Necronomicon) contain both easy and difficult spells.
    </p>
    <p>
        The level at which each individual spell is unlocked and the vis cost to cast each spell is not given here,
        since it will vary with each class that has access to this realm.
