    <h1>Items</h1>
    <p>
        While adventuring in Cthangband your character will find a large number of items, both mundane and magical. While some of these will be mere
        junk - or worse, actively cursed - others will be vital to your chances of winning the game. Most of these items, what they do, and how to use
        them, are described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of most magic items, the exact abilities of the item won't be apparent to you until you have identified it. There are various
        spells, scrolls, and staves that can identify items. However, you can use or wield unidentified items and you will get their full abilities and
        bonuses (or penalties!) even if you do not know what they are. Depending on the item, using it may be enough to partially or fully identify it.
        For example, if you use an unidentified wand and it shoots a magic missile then you will know that it is a wand of magic missiles, but you still
        won't know how many charges it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of weapons and armour, merely carrying them around can give you a good idea of whether they are good or bad; particularly if you
        use them in combat. However, this can be dangerous because if the weapon or armour is cursed then you may be stuck and unable to take it off
        until you manage to remove the curse.
    </p>
    <h2>Weapons</h2>
    <p>
        All weapons are described in a line that gives information about their combat capabilities. When an item has not yet been identified, you will
        only be shown the most basic information about it, for example:
    <p><span class=desc>a Scimitar (2d5)</span></p>
    <p>
        This indicates that the weapon is a scimitar and that will do 2d5 damage (see <a href="Combat.html">Combat</a> for more details of how weapon
        damage works). It may or may not have other properties, but you won't know what they are.
    </p>
    <p>
        A missile weapon will have a multiplier instead of damage dice. This indicates by how much it multiplies the damage done by the ammunition
        that it uses:
    </p>
    <p><span class=desc>a Long Bow (x2)</span></p>
    <p>Once you have identified the weapon, you will probably see something like the following:
    <p><span class=desc>a Scimitar (2d5) (+0,+0)</span></p>
    <p>
        This is a normal non-magical weapon. The two numbers after the damage show that the weapon has a +0 bonus to attacks and a +0 bonus to
        damage. Again, the Combat page gives details of how these numbers work. The first number is the attack bonus and the second is the damage bonus.
    </p>
    <p>If the scimitar was magical, the most common form of magical weapon is simply one that has an attack bonus and/or a damage bonus.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>a Scimitar (2d5) (+3,+8)</span></p>
    <p>As well as these common magical weapons, there are rare weapons that have one or more additional abilities. Some examples are shown below.</p>

        In addition to the rare weapon types described above, you may occasionally find an artifact weapon. Artifact weapons are all one-of-a-kind and are individually named. Some artifact weapons have fixed abilities, some have random abilities, and some a mixture of the two.
        Identifying an artifact will give you its name, but in order to find out its exact powers and abilities you will need to either fully identify it or notice the effect that it has on your abilities.
    </p>
    <h2>Armour</h2>
    <p>
        As with weapons, armour comes in four grades: normal, magical, rare, and artifact - and as with weapons, you are given limited information about
        the armour until you have identified it. When you first find a piece of armour, you are likely to see it described as follows:
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather [7]</span></p>
    <p>
        The number in square brackets shows the basic amount by which armour of this type increases your armour class. It may or may not have other properties but you will
        not know what they are.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have identified the armour, you will see something like:</p>
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather (-1) [7,+0]</span></p>
    <p>
        The '+0' here after the 7 shows that this is mundane non-magical armour that doesn't provide any additional armour class bonus on top of its normal value, and the -1 in
        parentheses before the armour class code shows that this armour will give you a -1 to-hit penalty because of its bulk and weight.
    </p>
    <p>Simple magic armour will have a bonus to armour class, but will not change the to-hit penalty:</p>
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather (-1) [7,+5]</span></p>
    <p>
        As with weapons, there are a large variety of different types of rare armour that have other bonuses or abilities besides a simple armour class bonus. Many of these
        are described below. Unlike weapons, which mostly share the same group of rare types, there are different types of rare armour for each armour slot.
    </p>
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather of Permanence (-1) [7,+5]</span></p>
    <p>Armour of permanence sustains all your ability scores so they cannot be reduced, and also protects you from having your life force drained. It also provides you with resistance to acid, cold, fire, and lightning.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather of Resist Acid (-1) [7,+5]</span></p>
    <p>Armour of resist acid provides you with acid resistance.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather of Resist Cold (-1) [7,+5]</span></p>
    <p>Armour of resist cold provides you with cold resistance.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather of Resist Fire (-1) [7,+5]</span></p>
    <p>Armour of resist fire provides you with fire resistance.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather of Resist Lightning (-1) [7,+5]</span></p>
    <p>Armour of resist lightning provides you with lightning resistance.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather of Resistance (-1) [7,+5]</span></p>
    <p>Armour of resistance provides you with acid resistance, cold resistance, fire resistance, and lightning resistance. </p>
    <p><span class=desc>Hard Studded Leather of Yith (-1) [7,+5] (+1 stealth)</span></p>
    <p>Armour of Yith provides you with acid resistance, cold resistance, fire resistance, and lightning resistance. It also improves your stealth by the amount shown.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>A pair of Soft Leather Boots (Winged) [2,+5]</span></p>
    <p>Winged boots prevent you from taking falling damage when you fall through a trap door or down a pit.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>A pair of Soft Leather Boots of Annoyance [2,+5] (+6)</span></p>
    <p>Boots of annoyance increase your speed by the value listed after the armour class bonus, but they also aggravate nearby monsters.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>A pair of Soft Leather Boots of Free Action [2,+5]</span></p>
    <p>Boots of free action prevent you from being paralysed.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>A pair of Soft Leather Boots of Noise [2,+5]</span></p>
    <p>Boots of noise aggravate nearby monsters.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>A pair of Soft Leather Boots of Slowness [2,+5] (-4)</span></p>
    <p>Boots of slowness reduce your speed by the value listed after the armour class bonus.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>A pair of Soft Leather Boots of Speed [2,+5] (+6)</span></p>
    <p>Boots of speed increase your speed by the value listed after the armour class bonus.</p>
    <p><span class=desc>A pair of Soft Leather Boots of Stealth [2,+5] (+2 stealth)</span></p>
    <p>Boots of stealth increase your stealth by the amount listed.</p>
