    <h1>The Elements</h1>
    <p>All matter is composed of elements, and magic can split those elements apart. In their pure form (such as in magical attacks), elemental forces can be very dangerous and have a variety of effects. Below is a list of the various types of damaging attack, and what possible extra effects they may have.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Acid</b><br>
        As well as simply damaging you, acid can damage your armour. Acid can occasionally damage your charisma.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Chaos</b><br>
        The energies of chaos can confuse you, corrupt you, damage your inventory or drain your life force. They are unpredictable and may do none, some or all of the above.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Cold</b><br>
        Cold damage can damage items in your inventory, and occasionally damage your strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Confusion</b><br>
        Confusion attacks can leave you stunned or confused.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Dark</b><br>
        Dark attacks can blind you, but will heal you if you are in wraithform.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Disenchantment</b><br>
        Disenchantment attacks can drain the magic from your armour and weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Electricity</b><br>
        As well as simply damaging you, electricity damage can destroy some items in your inventory (for example potions) and occasionally damage your dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Fire</b><br>
        As well as simply damaging you, fire can destroy various items in your inventory (for example scrolls). Fire can occasionally damage your strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Force</b><br>
        Direct telekinetic force can stun you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Gravity</b><br>
        Gravity can teleport you, slow you or stun you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Hell Fire</b><br>
        The polar opposite to holy fire, hell fire damages you less if you have an affinity with the Death realm, and more if you have an affinity with the Life realm.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Holy Fire</b><br>
        A spiritual flame, rather than a physical one - holy fire damages you less if you have an affinity with the Life realm, and more if you have an affinity with the Death realm.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Ice</b><br>
        Ice can cut you and stun you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Inertia</b><br>
        The forces of inertia can slow you down.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Light</b><br>
        Light attacks can blind you, and dispel wraithform.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Nether</b><br>
        Nether is the force of unlife. As such, it drains your life force from you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Nexus</b><br>
        Nexus, the element of locality, can teleport you around and warp your body.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Plasma</b><br>
        This hot liquid fire can penetrate even the toughest fire resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Poison</b><br>
        Poison continues to damage you over a period of time, or until magically cured. It can also occasionally damage your constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Radiation</b><br>
        Radiation acts like a combination of poison and acid, as well as possibly corrupting you and giving you a mutation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Shards</b><br>
        These sharp pieces of metal and rock can damage your inventory, and are extremely likely to make you bleed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Sound</b><br>
        Sound can stun you as well as damaging you normally.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Time</b><br>
        Time is a particularly nasty attack which can either revert you to a younger age or age you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Water</b><br>
        Water damage can stun and confuse you, as well as damaging items in your inventory.
