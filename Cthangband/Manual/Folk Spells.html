    <h1>Folk Spells</h1>
    <p>
        Spells are presented here ordered by book, reflecting how difficult each spell is to cast.
        Unlike the other realms of magic, which contain two common books of spells of increasing difficulty which can
        be bought in town and a further two rare books of assorted spells that can only be found in the dungeons, all four
        folk books are common and can be bought in town. Similarly, all four books contain spells of increasing difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
        The level at which each individual spell is unlocked and the mana cost to cast each spell is not given here,
        since it will vary with each class that has access to this realm.
