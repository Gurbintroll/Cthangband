    <h1>Mentalism Talents</h1>
    <p>
        The talents of mentalism work in a simlar way to spells, but they are not found in books and learned.
        Instead, a mindcrafter or mystic can automatically use any talent for which they have gained the minimum level.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike spells, which usually have a consistent effect with only things like damage increasing based on
        character level, mentalism talents will often have an increased or changed effect at higher level.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>a) Precognition</b><br>
        Initially, this detects monsters. It then starts also detecting traps (min lev = 5), invisible creatures (min lev = 15), revealing the layout of your surrounding area (min lev = 20), providing you with temporary ESP (min lev = 25) and revealing the layout of the whole level (min lev = 45).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>b) Neural Blast</b><br>
        This fires a bolt of psychic energy. Sometimes, this bolt will explode into a ball. It is more likely to become a ball if you are higher level.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>c) Minor Displacement</b><br>
        This will teleport you to a random nearby location. Once you are practiced with it (min lev = 25), you can choose your destination.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>d) Major Displacement</b><br>
        This will teleport you to a random place on the level. With practice (min lev = 30), it will also scatter any nearby monsters once you arrive, teleporting them away from your new location and leaving you in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>e) Domination</b><br>
        This will make all nearby monsters your friends. With practice (min lev = 30), you can use this power at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>f) Pulverise</b><br>
        This will fire a ball of sonic energy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>g) Character Armour</b><br>
        This will provide a temporary boost to your armour class. With practice it will also give you temporary resistance to acid (min lev = 14), fire (min lev = 20), cold (min lev = 25), electricity (min lev = 30) and poison (min lev = 35).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>h) Psychometry</b><br>
        This gives you a vague idea of the usefulness of an object. With practice (min lev = 40), you can identify the magical function of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>i) Mind Wave</b><br>
        This creates a ball of psychic energy around yourself. With practice (min lev = 25), this ball can be fired at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>j) Adrenaline Channeling</b><br>
        This stops you from being afraid or stunned, heals you slightly, gives you a temporary boost to your speed, and boosts your fighting ability. With practice (min lev = 35), the fighting bonus is increased.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>k) Psychic Drain</b><br>
        This fires a ball of negative psychic energy that sucks out the minds of its targets and channels the mental energy back to you, which you absorb as spell points.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>l) Telekinetic Wave</b><br>
        This fires a fierce blast of stunning telekinetic energy out in all directions.
